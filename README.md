Java Parser
========================
A simple parser to read in a CSV file generated from <a href="http://www.flurry.com/">Flurry</a> analytics and pull the relavent play data.  There were some lines formatted differently, and some data that were not relevant for what we need at the current time.  Those had to be filtered out.
